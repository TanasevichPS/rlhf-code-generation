            "Question": "Is there a torchsummary equivalent in Tensorflow?. I am using GPU to run some very large deep learning models on a dataset of size 55GB. If I use a batch size greater than 1, I get a resource exhausted error. Even with a batch size of 1, I get segmentation faults. GPU memory is 10GB and Server has 32GB of RAM. Is there a way that I could know how large the data (batch size of 1) will occupy in the GPU? I am using tf.Keras to fit models. Is there a torchsummary equivalent in TensorFlow? ",

The net effect is that on some platforms, when you allocate many objects, python \u2019 s memory usage may actually drop when you delete them and the memory may be returned to the operating system.
