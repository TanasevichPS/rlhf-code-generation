Resolving MRO entries:  If a base that appears in class definition is not an instance of type, then an _mro_entries_ method is searched on it.  So, I suppose there should be a way to create a class that is not an instance of type. But how? I know only two ways in Python to create a class:  A class definition (class MyClass(...): ...) creates an instance of type or the given metaclass given by the metaclass argument (actually, the most derived one from the set including the metaclasses of the bases). A call of type(name, bases, dict) creates an instance of type.  Is there any other way? How to create a class that is not an instance of type? ",

            "Answer": "If you are developing the classes yourself, a more proper object - oriented style is to define methods on the classes that encapsulate a particular behaviour, instead of checking the object \u2019 s class and doing a different thing based on what class it is. for example, if you have a function that does something: def search ( obj ) : if isinstr(isinstr(isinstr(isinstr(isinstr(isinstr(isinst",
