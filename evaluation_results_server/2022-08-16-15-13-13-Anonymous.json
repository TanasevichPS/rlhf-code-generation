Now I want to run the same model on 100,000 other sets of input and save it. Is there any libraries I should look into? I just have to change the inputs. Any guidance will be appreciated. TIA! ",

( contributed by eric smith ; bpo - 5237. ) complex numbers now correctly support usage with format ( ), and default to being right - aligned. specifying a precision or comma - separation applies to both the real and imaginary parts of the number, but a specified field width and alignment is applied to the whole of the resulting 1. 5 + 3j output.
