Given a (lat,lng) point and an all type OSMNX network, how can I find which nodes in the graph are within 1km walking distance from the point? I was thinking about calculating the great circle distance between each node and the point and checking whether it is at most 1km, but I do not believe this will be very accurate since the topology of the network will be ignored.
