My client is a Python application using the dialogflowcx_v3beta1 SDK to call DetectIntent. The application needs to forward the custom payload in JSON format to another application, but I have been unable to find a way to convert the structured payload to JSON. There is no schema associated with the custom payload, which could be literally any valid JSON, and because it will simply be forwarded to another component, the application has no reason to interpret the content in any way. Is there a way to serialize the custom payload to JSON? ",
