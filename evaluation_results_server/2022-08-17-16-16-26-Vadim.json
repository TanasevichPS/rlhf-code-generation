I'm new to python programming and doing some challenges to improve my coding; I encounter the following regular expression: (r^[a-zA-Z][\\w_]{2,23}[^_]$). Doing some research, I understand this: r = The expression is a raw string (not sure what this mean entirely) ^[a-zA-Z] = This tells me that the string must start with a letter [\\w_]{2,23} = the body of the string from val[2] to val[23] must be alphanumeric [^_]$ = the end must be an underscore If my research is correct, I don't understand why the [\\w_] contains an underscore on it. I thought for alphanumerics must be only [\\w]. If I'm wrong, help me to clarify it. ",
