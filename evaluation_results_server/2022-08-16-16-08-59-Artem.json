            "Question": "File dependend DAG execution. I build a DAG that begins with the download of a file over the SFTPOperator, I save it and proceed with accessing and processing it, with a PythonOperator. I had no issues with this approach at all, till I started to scale up my celery-workers from 1 to 2. Now I run in to the problem of a file that isn't available in both workers. How do I solve it? Do I download the file over the SFTPHook and combine these Tasks? Can I constrain the spread on to different workers? kind regards, CreedsCode ",
