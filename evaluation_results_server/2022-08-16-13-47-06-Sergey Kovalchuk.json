            "Question": "How can I classify a dataset after one-hot encoding the target class?. I want to Classify a dataset with kernel machine. The Target-Class has 5 different values and I want to one-hot encoding it. After that I have 5 Target-Columns. I do the Training 5 times, one time per Target-Column. Now I want to classify a new sample. I classify the Sample 5 times using the 5 Trainig-model I got. At the end I look which Prediction has the maximum value over the 5 predictions and then I classify the sample according to the Class with the maximum prediction. I am not sure that I am doing the right thing. How can I do that in the right way? ",
