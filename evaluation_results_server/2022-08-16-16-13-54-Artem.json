My task is as follows: if I input s=5 and idx=[2,3] with numerical values [0.3, 0.7], it means that I have to create a list [t0, t1, 0.3, 0.7, t4]. The list can be treated as a function of three variables t0, t1, and t4. I guess I may need to use *args, but I do not how to do it in general. ",
            "Answer": "' '* 2 ) this gives you a list that contains 5 lambdas that calculate x * * 2. you might expect that, when called, they would return, respectively, 0, 1, 4, 9, and 16 however, when you actually try you will see that they all return 16: &gt;&gt;&gt; x * * 2 &gt;&gt;&gt; x * * 2 &gt;&gt;&gt; x * * 2 &gt;&gt;&gt",
