            "Question": "how to set correct batch_size and steps_per_epoch in keras?. I have 20000 RGB images. I set batch_Size = 1 (due to GPU capacity). So now does it mean the model weights are changing with one-by-one pictures or it depends on the steps_per_epoch? How should I set the steps_per_epoch and epochs for using all of 20000 images to be involved in training in different epochs? ",

            "Answer": "The threading module now lets you set the stack size used when new threads are created. The stack_size ( [ * size * ] ) function returns the currently configured stack size, and supplying the optional size parameter sets a new value. Not all platforms support changing the stack size, but windows, posix threading, and os / 2 all do.",
