            "Question": "Method of opening .py scripts without packages installed? (pip). Essentially want to send a script to my friend to go over. He has python installed on his computer, but doesn't specifically have 'pyinputplus' - a key component of the program. Is there a way that I can send this script to him without him installing pyinputplus? Or whether I can effectively insert 'pip install pyinputplus' into the code and have it execute when he runs it? I had also considered making the script an executable, but didn't think that would help. Relatively new to this, so apologies for my naivety. Thanks. ",
