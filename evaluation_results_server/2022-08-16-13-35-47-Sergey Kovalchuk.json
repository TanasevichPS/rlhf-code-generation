            "Question": "Build Flask App that fetch data from postgres database without page reload. I have a flask web app that shows data from sqlalchemy to the user. I want the app to fetch any new data when it is added to the database automatically without further ado from the client-side (something like news feeds). How do I achieve that. I know that I should use socket.io but don't know-how. All examples in google are about chat app. It would be very helpful if somebody could give me the roadmap to do it. The front end in js and the backend is in flask python. any help will be appreciated! Thanks ",
