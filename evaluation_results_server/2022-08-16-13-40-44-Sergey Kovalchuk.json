            "Question": "Getting connected partitions using METIS. I am using Metis on Python to partition a networkx graph I have. My objective is to get partitions that have an almost equal sum of node weights, which Metis does perfectly. However, a constraint I want to respect is that nodes in the same partition should be connected (have edges in common), which Metis doesn't do. Is there a way or a parameter to ensure that? ",
