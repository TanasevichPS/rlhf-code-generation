( contributed by eric smith ; bpo - 5237. ) complex numbers now correctly support usage with format ( ), and default to being right - aligned. specifying a precision or comma - separation applies to both the real and imaginary parts of the number, but a specified field width and alignment is applied to the whole of the resulting 1. 5 + 3j output.
