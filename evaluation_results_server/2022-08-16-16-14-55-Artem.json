I was using just a setup.py file, but I added a pyproject.toml in accordance with this tutorial, which appears to have been recently updated to include that file. What I can't tell from that tutorial or this one, is whether I need to have a setup.cfg if I'm still using setup.py, and if so, what should be in it. It does show a file tree with both, but then implies that file structure is only indicative with (for people using primarily setup.cfg)  If you create a setup.py file, this will enable direct interaction with setup.py (which generally should be avoided), and editable installs. This file used to be required, but can be omitted in modern setuptools.  ",
