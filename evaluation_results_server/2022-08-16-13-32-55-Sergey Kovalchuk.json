            "Question": "Method of opening .py scripts without packages installed? (pip). Essentially want to send a script to my friend to go over. He has python installed on his computer, but doesn't specifically have 'pyinputplus' - a key component of the program. Is there a way that I can send this script to him without him installing pyinputplus? Or whether I can effectively insert 'pip install pyinputplus' into the code and have it execute when he runs it? I had also considered making the script an executable, but didn't think that would help. Relatively new to this, so apologies for my naivety. Thanks. ",

            "Answer": "The python launcher for windows is a utility which aids in locating and executing of different python versions. it allows scripts ( or the command - line ) to indicate a preference for a specific python version, and will locate and execute that version. unlike the path variable, the launcher will correctly select the most appropriate version of python. it will prefer per - user installations over system - wide ones, and orders by language version.",
