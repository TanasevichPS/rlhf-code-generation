"How to Use ""Pythonic"" YOLOv5 from PyTorch. I'm interested in training a YOLOv5 model. Currently, I'm using Roboflow to annotate and export the data into YOLOv5 format. I'm also using Roboflow's Colab Notebook for YOLOv5. However, I'm not familiar with many of the commands used in the Roboflow Colab Notebook. I found on here that there appears to be a much more Pythonic way of using and manipulating the YOLOv5 model, which I would be much more familiar with. My questions regarding this are as follows:  Is there an online resource that can show me how to train the YOLOv5 and extract results after importing the model from PyTorch with the Pythonic version (perhaps a snippet of code right here on StackOverflow would help)? The official documentation that I could find (here) also uses the non-Pythonic method for the model. Is there any important functionality I would lose if I were to switch to this Pythonic method of using YOLOv5? I found nothing in the documentation that suggests otherwise, but would I need to export my data in a different format from Roboflow for the data to be able to train the Pythonic model? Similar to question 1), is there anywhere that can guide me how to use the trained model on test images? Do I simply do prediction=model(my_image.jpg)? What if I want predictions on multiple images at once?  Any guidance would be appreciated. Thanks! ","

I'm building a script to automate some stuff on my Android emulator I'm currently using pyautogui to do it tho it would be nice if there was some sort of way I can directly interact with the emulator without it relying on my mouse I know there's an option using ADB but that requires the android to be rooted a lot of android emulators like Nox, Bluestacks, LDplayer have built-in macros that don't require the device to be rooted. How do these emulators send commands to the emulator is that something I can tap into and send commands through that instead?

"How to disable SQLAlchemy lazy loads on detached instance relationships?. I've developed a JDO-like Fetch Group feature in Python with SQLAlchemy to control the pruning of object graphs for marshalling web service responses. During this process I detach the instances using session.expunge(entity) The issue is that when the JSON marshaller or pydantic accesses an instance attribute relationship which was not loaded yet, even though the instance is detached, the SQLAlchemy lazy loading still kicks in for that attribute and fails because the instance is not bound to a session anymore (obviously): DetachedInstanceError(Parent instance MyClass at 0x1439051f0 is not bound to a Session; lazy load operation of attribute 'relation' cannot proceed) So, my first question, is why are the lazy loaders not disabled when an instance is detached as it doesn't make sense to me. Secondly, if that is a feature, how can I disable or work-around lazy loaders to prevent this error and let the  attribute relationship in question appear None to the marshaller? I have found that setting self.__dict__['relation'] = None helps in some circumstance in fooling the lazy loaders in not kicking in but it does not always work unfortunately...
